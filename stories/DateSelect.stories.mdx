# Date Select

Summary of what the component is and it's purpose for existing in Apollo.

## Table of Contents

Add a table of contents so that users can quickly look over the documentation with
convenient hyperlinks. Also link to headers that you place throughout to elaborate
on the sections. This will be useful for the user when they have to scroll over
everything.

## Functionality

Explain different behaviors this component may have. This is an excellent place to talk
about the `type` prop if it exists. Also it's good to show what different forms this
component can take. Also explain some features that may be unclear to somone using 
Apollo
for the first time.

Always give examples of setup and steps using canvases

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Basic Date Select" args={{ placeholder: "Pick a date" }}>
		{BasicDateSelect.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## Other Props & Functionalities

Transition focus to other functionalities. Maybe introduce some of them or talk about 
other props briefly. That way the user isn't abruptly introduce to the ArgsTable 
below.

<ArgsTable of={DateSelect} />
